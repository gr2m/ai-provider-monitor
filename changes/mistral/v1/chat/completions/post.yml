    - path: requestBody.content.application/json.schema.properties.frequency_penalty.description
      before: frequency_penalty penalizes the repetition of words based on their frequency in the generated text. A higher frequency penalty discourages the model from repeating words that have already appeared frequently in the output, promoting diversity and reducing repetition.
      after: The `frequency_penalty` penalizes the repetition of words based on their frequency in the generated text. A higher frequency penalty discourages the model from repeating words that have already appeared frequently in the output, promoting diversity and reducing repetition.
    - path: requestBody.content.application/json.schema.properties.presence_penalty.description
      before: presence_penalty determines how much the model penalizes the repetition of words or phrases. A higher presence penalty encourages the model to use a wider variety of words and phrases, making the output more diverse and creative.

      after: Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use, when enabled the model can call multiple tools in parallel.
    - path: requestBody.content.application/json.schema.properties.prediction.description
      before: Enable users to specify expected results, optimizing response times by leveraging known or predictable content. This approach is especially effective for updating text documents or code files with minimal changes, reducing latency while maintaining high-quality results.
