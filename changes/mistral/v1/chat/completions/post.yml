    - path: requestBody.content.application/json.schema.properties.frequency_penalty.description
      before: frequency_penalty penalizes the repetition of words based on their frequency in the generated text. A higher frequency penalty discourages the model from repeating words that have already appeared frequently in the output, promoting diversity and reducing repetition.

      before: presence_penalty determines how much the model penalizes the repetition of words or phrases. A higher presence penalty encourages the model to use a wider variety of words and phrases, making the output more diverse and creative.
