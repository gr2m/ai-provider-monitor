  note: Clarified descriptions for frequency_penalty and presence_penalty.
  paths:
    - path: $.requestBody.content.application/json.schema.properties.frequency_penalty.description
      before: frequency_penalty penalizes the repetition of words based on their frequency in the generated text. A higher frequency penalty discourages the model from repeating words that have already appeared frequently in the output, promoting diversity and reducing repetition.
      after: The `frequency_penalty` penalizes the repetition of words based on their frequency in the generated text. A higher frequency penalty discourages the model from repeating words that have already appeared frequently in the output, promoting diversity and reducing repetition.
    - path: $.requestBody.content.application/json.schema.properties.presence_penalty.description
      before: presence_penalty determines how much the model penalizes the repetition of words or phrases. A higher presence penalty encourages the model to use a wider variety of words and phrases, making the output more diverse and creative.
      after: The `presence_penalty` determines how much the model penalizes the repetition of words or phrases. A higher presence penalty encourages the model to use a wider variety of words and phrases, making the output more diverse and creative.
