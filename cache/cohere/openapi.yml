        The model can be forced into outputting JSON objects (with up to 5 levels of nesting) by setting `{ "type": "json_object" }`.

        A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) can optionally be provided, to ensure a specific structure.

        **Note**: When using  `{ "type": "json_object" }` your `message` should always explicitly instruct the model to generate a JSON (eg: _"Generate a JSON ..."_) . Otherwise the model may end up getting stuck generating an infinite stream of characters and eventually run out of context length.
        **Limitation**: The parameter is not supported in RAG mode (when any of `connectors`, `documents`, `tools`, `tool_results` are provided).

                    A list of previous messages between the user and the model, giving the model conversational context for responding to the user's `message`.

                    Each item represents a single message in the chat history, excluding the current user turn. It has two properties: `role` and `message`. The `role` identifies the sender (`CHATBOT`, `SYSTEM`, or `USER`), while the `message` contains the text content.

                    The chat_history parameter should not be used for `SYSTEM` messages in most cases. Instead, to add a `SYSTEM` role message at the beginning of a conversation, the `preamble` parameter should be used.

                    A list of relevant documents that the model can cite to generate a more accurate reply. Each document is a string-string dictionary.

                    Example:
                    ```
                    [
                      { "title": "Tall penguins", "text": "Emperor penguins are the tallest." },
                      { "title": "Penguin habitats", "text": "Emperor penguins only live in Antarctica." },
                    ]
                    ```

                    Keys and values from each document will be serialized to a string and passed to the model. The resulting generation will include citations that reference some of these documents.

                    Some suggested keys are "text", "author", and "date". For better generation quality, it is recommended to keep the total word count of the strings in the dictionary to under 300 words.

                    An `id` field (string) can be optionally supplied to identify the document in the citations. This field will not be passed to the model.

                    An `_excludes` field (array of strings) can be optionally supplied to omit some key-value pairs from being shown to the model. The omitted fields will still show up in the citation object. The "_excludes" field will not be passed to the model.

                    See ['Document Mode'](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag#document-mode) in the guide for more information.

                    The `SYSTEM` role is also used for the contents of the optional `chat_history=` parameter. When used with the `chat_history=` parameter it adds content throughout a conversation. Conversely, when used with the `preamble=` parameter it adds content at the start of the conversation only.

                    A list of results from invoking tools recommended by the model in the previous chat turn. Results are used to produce a text response and will be referenced in citations. When using `tool_results`, `tools` must be passed as well.
                    Each tool_result contains information about how it was invoked, as well as a list of outputs in the form of dictionaries.

                    **Note**: `outputs` must be a list of objects. If your tool returns a single object (eg `{"status": 200}`), make sure to wrap it in a list.
                    ```
                    tool_results = [
                      {
                        "call": {
                          "name": <tool name>,
                          "parameters": {
                            <param name>: <param value>
                          }
                        },
                        "outputs": [{
                          <key>: <value>
                        }]
                      },
                      ...
                    ]
                    ```
                    **Note**: Chat calls with `tool_results` should not be included in the Chat history to avoid duplication of the message text.

                    When `tools` is passed (without `tool_results`), the `text` field in the response will be `""` and the `tool_calls` field in the response will be populated with a list of tool calls that need to be made. If no calls need to be made, the `tool_calls` array will be empty.

                    Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. They use deep learning architectures, particularly transformers, to process and produce language.

                    Key characteristics of LLMs include:

                    1. **Scale**: They're trained on billions or trillions of parameters, making them capable of understanding complex patterns in language.

                    2. **Versatility**: LLMs can perform various tasks like translation, summarization, question answering, and creative writing without being explicitly programmed for each task.

                    3. **Context Understanding**: They can maintain context over long conversations and generate coherent, contextually relevant responses.

                    4. **Few-shot Learning**: LLMs can often perform new tasks with just a few examples, adapting to new scenarios quickly.

                    Popular examples include GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, BERT, and Cohere's Command models. These models have revolutionized natural language processing and enabled new applications across industries.

After all, the all-time record year for the music business, as far as revenues in billion dollars are concerned, was actually 1999. That is, back when this five men group was at its peak.',

The latter is the only one we haven’t study so far. It took 15 years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.\n\nIt wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.",

If Jonas Brothers and more recently One Direction reached a great level of popularity during the past decade, the type of success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a completely different level as they really dominated the business for a few years all over the world, including in some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western artists.\n\nWe will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this new article with final results which will more than surprise many readers.',

Or were they a global phenomenon?\n\nAs usual, I’ll be using the Commensurate Sales to Popularity Concept in order to relevantly gauge their results. This concept will not only bring you sales information for all NSYNC‘s albums, physical and download singles, as well as audio and video streaming, but it will also determine their true popularity. If you are not yet familiar with the CSPC method, the next page explains it with a short video. I fully recommend watching the video before getting into the sales figures.',

                    Both NSync and Backstreet Boys were extremely popular at the turn of the millennium. Backstreet Boys had massive album sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty of chart-topping releases, hyped tours, and tremendous media coverage. NSync also had huge sales, with their album No Strings Attached selling 2.4 million units in its first week. They also had the second fastest-selling album of the Soundscan era before 2015, with Celebrity debuting at 1.88 million units sold.

                    While it is difficult to say for sure which of the two bands was more popular, Backstreet Boys did have success in some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western artists.

        This endpoint makes a prediction about which label fits the specified text inputs best. To make a prediction, Classify uses the provided `examples` of text + label pairs as a reference.
        Note: [Fine-tuned models](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/classify-fine-tuning) trained on classification examples don't require the `examples` parameter to be passed in explicitly.

                    An array of examples to provide context to the model. Each example is a text string and its associated label/class. Each unique label requires at least 2 examples associated with it; the maximum number of examples is 2500, and each example has a maximum length of 512 tokens. The values should be structured as `{text: "...",label: "..."}`.

                    A list of up to 96 texts to be classified. Each one must be a non-empty string.
                    There is, however, no consistent, universal limit to the length a particular input can be. We perform classification on the first `x` tokens of each input, and `x` varies depending on which underlying model is powering classification. The maximum token length for each model is listed in the "max tokens" column [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models).
                    Note: by default the `truncate` parameter is set to `END`, so tokens exceeding the limit will be automatically dropped. This behavior can be disabled by setting `truncate` to `NONE`, which will result in validation errors for longer texts.

        This endpoint returns text and image embeddings. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the content that it represents.

        Embeddings can be used to create classifiers as well as empower semantic search. To learn more about embeddings, see the embedding page.

        If you want to learn more how to use the embedding model, have a look at the [Semantic Search Guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/semantic-search).

                    * `"int8"`: Use this when you want to get back signed int8 embeddings. Supported with Embed v3.0 and newer Embed models.
                    * `"uint8"`: Use this when you want to get back unsigned int8 embeddings. Supported with Embed v3.0 and newer Embed models.
                    * `"binary"`: Use this when you want to get back signed binary embeddings. Supported with Embed v3.0 and newer Embed models.
                    * `"ubinary"`: Use this when you want to get back unsigned binary embeddings. Supported with Embed v3.0 and newer Embed models.

                    LLMs, or Large Language Models, are a type of neural network-based AI model that has been trained on massive amounts of text data and have become ubiquitous in the AI landscape. They possess astounding capabilities for comprehending and generating human-like language.
                    These models leverage neural networks that operate on a large scale, often involving millions or even billions of parameters. This substantial scale enables them to capture intricate patterns and connections within the vast amounts of text they have been trained on.

                    The training process for LLMs is fueled by colossal datasets of textual information, ranging from books and articles to websites and conversational transcripts. This extensive training enables them to develop a nuanced understanding of language patterns, grammar, and semantics.

                    When posed with a new text input, LLMs employ their finely honed understanding of language to generate informed responses or undertake tasks such as language translation, text completion, or question answering. They do this by manipulating the input text through adding, removing, or altering elements to craft a desired output.

                    One of the underlying principles of their efficacy is the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture they often adopt. This design enables them to process sequential data like natural language effectively. RNNs possess "memory" aspects via loops between layers, which allows them to retain and manipulate information gathered across long sequences, akin to the way humans process information.

                    However, it's their size that arguably constitutes their most notable aspect. The sheer volume of these models – with counts of parameters often exceeding 100 million – enables them to capture correlations and patterns within language data effectively. This empowers them to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses, posing a remarkable advancement in conversational AI.

                    While LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary language prowess, it's vital to acknowledge their limitations and potential for improvement. Their biases often reflect those of the training data, and they may struggle with logical inconsistencies or factual errors. Ongoing research aims to enhance their robustness, diversity, and overall usability.

                    In essence, LLMs are a groundbreaking manifestation of AI's potential to simulate and even extend human language capabilities, while also serving as a testament to the ongoing journey towards refining and perfecting these technologies.

                    **Note**: If `max_tokens` is set higher than the model's maximum output token limit, the generation will be capped at that model-specific maximum limit.

                    When `NONE` is specified, the model will be forced **not** to use one of the specified tools, and give a direct response.
                    If tool_choice isn't specified, then the model is free to choose whether to use the specified tools or not.

                      LLMs stand for Large Language Models, which are a type of neural network model specialized in processing and generating human language. They are designed to understand and respond to natural language input and have become increasingly popular and valuable in recent years.

                      LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to learn patterns, grammar, and semantic meanings present in the language. These models can then be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, summarization, question answering, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and even some aspects of natural language understanding.

                      Some well-known examples of LLMs include:

                      1. GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) — An open-source LLM developed by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like text and performing various language tasks.

                      2. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) — A Google-developed LLM that is particularly good at understanding contextual relationships in text, and is widely used for natural language understanding tasks like sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.

                      3. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) — Also from Google, T5 is a flexible LLM that frames all language tasks as text-to-text problems, where the model learns to generate output text based on input text prompts.

                      4. RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) — A variant of BERT that uses additional training techniques to improve performance.

                      5. DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) — Another variant of BERT that introduces a new attention mechanism.

                      LLMs have become increasingly powerful and larger in scale, improving the accuracy and sophistication of language tasks. They are also being used as a foundation for developing various applications, including chatbots, content recommendation systems, language translation services, and more.
                      The future of LLMs holds the potential for even more sophisticated language technologies, with ongoing research and development focused on enhancing their capabilities, improving efficiency, and exploring their applications in various domains.

                    At one point, Backstreet Boys defined success: massive albums sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty of chart topping releases, hugely hyped tours and tremendous media coverage.

                    It is true that they benefited from extraordinarily good market conditions in all markets. After all, the all-time record year for the music business, as far as revenues in billion dollars are concerned, was actually 1999. That is, back when this five men group was at its peak.

                    At the turn of the millennium three teen acts were huge in the US, the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. The latter is the only one we haven’t study so far. It took 15 years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.

                    It wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.

                    Yet the way many music consumers – especially teenagers and young women’s – embraced their output deserves its own chapter. If Jonas Brothers and more recently One Direction reached a great level of popularity during the past decade, the type of success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a completely different level as they really dominated the business for a few years all over the world, including in some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western artists.

                    We will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this new article with final results which will more than surprise many readers.

                    As usual, I’ll be using the Commensurate Sales to Popularity Concept in order to relevantly gauge their results. This concept will not only bring you sales information for all NSYNC‘s albums, physical and download singles, as well as audio and video streaming, but it will also determine their true popularity. If you are not yet familiar with the CSPC method, the next page explains it with a short video. I fully recommend watching the video before getting into the sales figures.

                            At one point, Backstreet Boys defined success: massive albums sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty of chart topping releases, hugely hyped tours and tremendous media coverage.

                            It is true that they benefited from extraordinarily good market conditions in all markets. After all, the all-time record year for the music business, as far as revenues in billion dollars are concerned, was actually 1999. That is, back when this five men group was at its peak.

                            MJD Posted on February 9, 2018 Posted in CSPC 27 Comments Tagged with Boy band, N'Sync

                            At the turn of the millennium three teen acts were huge in the US, the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. The latter is the only one we haven’t study so far. It took 15 years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.

                            It wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.

                            1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001 also rank amongst some of the very best years.
                            Yet the way many music consumers – especially teenagers and young women’s – embraced their output deserves its own chapter. If Jonas Brothers and more recently One Direction reached a great level of popularity during the past decade, the type of success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a completely different level as they really dominated the business for a few years all over the world, including in some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western artists.

                            We will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this new article with final results which will more than surprise many readers.

                      Both NSync and Backstreet Boys were extremely popular at the turn of the millennium. Backstreet Boys had massive album sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty of chart-topping releases, hyped tours, and tremendous media coverage. NSync also had huge sales, with their album No Strings Attached selling 2.4 million units in its first week. They also had the second fastest-selling album of the Soundscan era before 2015, with Celebrity debuting at 1.88 million units sold.

                      While it is difficult to say for sure which of the two bands was more popular, Backstreet Boys did have success in some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western artists.

                      The image you've provided is quite abstract and blurred, making it challenging to discern specific details. However, I can describe the general shapes and colors present:

                      1. **Shapes and Colors:**
                        - There are three main shapes in the image.
                        - The largest shape at the top is a dark green, irregular oval.
                        - Below it, on the left, there's a smaller, bright orange circle.
                        - To the right of the orange circle, there's another oval shape, this one in a light purple color.

                      2. **Arrangement:**
                        - The green oval is positioned at the top center of the image.
                        - The orange circle is directly below the green oval, slightly to the left.
                        - The purple oval is to the right of the orange circle, forming a rough triangular arrangement with the other two shapes.

                      3. **Blurriness:**
                        - The entire image is blurred, which softens the edges of the shapes and makes it difficult to identify any specific details or textures within the shapes.

                      Given the abstract nature of the image, it's open to interpretation. The shapes could represent various objects or concepts depending on the viewer's perspective. If you have any specific questions about the image or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

                                CSPC: NSYNC Popularity Analysis

                                MJD Posted on February 9, 2018 Posted in CSPC 27 Comments Tagged with Boy band, N'Sync

                                At the turn of the millennium three teen acts were huge in the US, the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. The latter is the only one we haven't study so far. It took 15 years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.

                                It wasn't a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.

        This endpoint returns text embeddings. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the text that it represents.

        Embeddings can be used to create text classifiers as well as empower semantic search. To learn more about embeddings, see the embedding page.

        If you want to learn more how to use the embedding model, have a look at the [Semantic Search Guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/semantic-search).
