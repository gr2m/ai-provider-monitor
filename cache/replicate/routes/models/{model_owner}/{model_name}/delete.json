Currently you'll need to [delete the model's versions](#models.versions.delete) before you can delete the model itself.\n\nExample cURL request:\n\n```command\ncurl -s -X DELETE \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN\" \\\n  https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world\n```\n\nThe response will be an empty 204, indicating the model has been deleted.\n",
