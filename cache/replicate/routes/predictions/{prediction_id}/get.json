Possible values are `web` or `api`.\n\n`status` will be one of:\n\n- `starting`: the prediction is starting up. If this status lasts longer than a few seconds, then it's typically because a new worker is being started to run the prediction.\n- `processing`: the `predict()` method of the model is currently running.\n- `succeeded`: the prediction completed successfully.\n- `failed`: the prediction encountered an error during processing.\n- `canceled`: the prediction was canceled by its creator.\n\nIn the case of success, `output` will be an object containing the output of the model. Any files will be represented as HTTPS URLs. You'll need to pass the `Authorization` header to request them.\n\nIn the case of failure, `error` will contain the error encountered during the prediction.\n\nTerminated predictions (with a status of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`) will include a `metrics` object with a `predict_time` property showing the amount of CPU or GPU time, in seconds, that the prediction used while running. It won't include time waiting for the prediction to start. The `metrics` object will also include a `total_time` property showing the total time, in seconds, that the prediction took to complete.\n\nAll input parameters, output values, and logs are automatically removed after an hour, by default, for predictions created through the API.\n\nYou must save a copy of any data or files in the output if you'd like to continue using them. The `output` key will still be present, but it's value will be `null` after the output has been removed.\n\nOutput files are served by `replicate.delivery` and its subdomains. If you use an allow list of external domains for your assets, add `replicate.delivery` and `*.replicate.delivery` to it.\n",
