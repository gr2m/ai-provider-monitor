If this status lasts longer than a few seconds, then it's typically because a new worker is being started to run the training.\n- `processing`: the `train()` method of the model is currently running.\n- `succeeded`: the training completed successfully.\n- `failed`: the training encountered an error during processing.\n- `canceled`: the training was canceled by its creator.\n\nIn the case of success, `output` will be an object containing the output of the model. Any files will be represented as HTTPS URLs. You'll need to pass the `Authorization` header to request them.\n\nIn the case of failure, `error` will contain the error encountered during the training.\n\nTerminated trainings (with a status of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`) will include a `metrics` object with a `predict_time` property showing the amount of CPU or GPU time, in seconds, that the training used while running. It won't include time waiting for the training to start. The `metrics` object will also include a `total_time` property showing the total time, in seconds, that the training took to complete.\n",
