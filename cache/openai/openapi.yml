    AssistantStreamEvent:
      description: |
        Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.

        Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:

        ```
        event: thread.created
        data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
        ```

        We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
        streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
        is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
        to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
        `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
        `thread.message.completed` event.

        We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
        in your code. See the [Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn how to
        integrate the Assistants API with streaming.

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

        **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

                the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.
                The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should
                decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100

You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

            As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

        asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after
        the Response events.

        separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model.

            The default system instructions (i.e. system message) prepended to model calls. This field allows the client to guide the model on desired responses. The model can be instructed on response content and format, (e.g. "be extremely succinct", "act friendly", "here are examples of good responses") and on audio behavior (e.g. "talk quickly", "inject emotion into your voice", "laugh frequently"). The instructions are not guaranteed to be followed by the model, but they provide guidance to the model on the desired behavior.
            Note that the server sets default instructions which will be used if this field is not set and are visible in the `session.created` event at the start of the session.

        This event is the output of audio transcription for user audio written to the

        committed by the client or server (when VAD is enabled). Transcription runs
        asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after
        the Response events.

        Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a
        separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model.
        The transcript may diverge somewhat from the model's interpretation, and
        should be treated as a rough guide.

    RealtimeServerEventInputAudioBufferTimeoutTriggered:
      description: |
        Returned when the Server VAD timeout is triggered for the input audio buffer. This is configured
        with `idle_timeout_ms` in the `turn_detection` settings of the session, and it indicates that
        there hasn't been any speech detected for the configured duration.

        The `audio_start_ms` and `audio_end_ms` fields indicate the segment of audio after the last
        model response up to the triggering time, as an offset from the beginning of audio written
        to the input audio buffer. This means it demarcates the segment of audio that was silent and
        the difference between the start and end values will roughly match the configured timeout.

        The empty audio will be committed to the conversation as an `input_audio` item (there will be a
        `input_audio_buffer.committed` event) and a model response will be generated. There may be speech
        that didn't trigger VAD but is still detected by the model, so the model may respond with
        something relevant to the conversation or a prompt to continue speaking.

Input audio transcription is not native to the model, since the model consumes audio directly. Transcription runs asynchronously through [the /audio/transcriptions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createTranscription) and should be treated as guidance of input audio content rather than precisely what the model heard. The client can optionally set the language and prompt for transcription, these offer additional guidance to the transcription service.

            responses") and on audio behavior (e.g. "talk quickly", "inject emotion

Transcription runs asynchronously through [the /audio/transcriptions endpoint](/docs/api-reference/audio/createTranscription) and should be treated as guidance of input audio content rather than precisely what the model heard. The client can optionally set the language and prompt for transcription, these offer additional guidance to the transcription service.

    RealtimeTruncation:
      description: |
        When the number of tokens in a conversation exceeds the model's input token limit, the conversation be truncated, meaning messages (starting from the oldest) will not be included in the model's context. A 32k context model with 4,096 max output tokens can only include 28,224 tokens in the context before truncation occurs.

        Clients can configure truncation behavior to truncate with a lower max token limit, which is an effective way to control token usage and cost.

        Truncation will reduce the number of cached tokens on the next turn (busting the cache), since messages are dropped from the beginning of the context. However, clients can also configure truncation to retain messages up to a fraction of the maximum context size, which will reduce the need for future truncations and thus improve the cache rate.

        Truncation can be disabled entirely, which means the server will never truncate but would instead return an error if the conversation exceeds the model's input token limit.

            Configuration for turn detection, ether Server VAD or Semantic VAD. This can be set to `null` to turn off, in which case the client must manually trigger model response.

            Server VAD means that the model will detect the start and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech.

            Semantic VAD is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjunction with VAD) to semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then dynamically sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio trails off with "uhhm", the model will score a low probability of turn end and wait longer for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more natural conversations, but may have a higher latency.

          or [file search](/docs/guides/tools-file-search). Learn more about
          [built-in tools](/docs/guides/tools).
        - **MCP Tools**: Integrations with third-party systems via custom MCP servers
          or predefined connectors such as Google Drive and SharePoint. Learn more about
          [MCP Tools](/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp).
        - **Function calls (custom tools)**: Functions that are defined by you,
          enabling the model to call your own code with strongly typed arguments
          and outputs. Learn more about
          [function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling). You can also use

        **Starting a new project?** We recommend trying [Responses](/docs/api-reference/responses)
        to take advantage of the latest OpenAI platform features. Compare
        [Chat Completions with Responses](/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions?api-mode=responses).

        ---

        Creates a model response for the given chat conversation. Learn more in the
        [text generation](/docs/guides/text-generation), [vision](/docs/guides/vision),
        and [audio](/docs/guides/audio) guides.

        Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the
        response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only
        supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of
        unsupported parameters in reasoning models,
        [refer to the reasoning guide](/docs/guides/reasoning).

        Returns a chat completion object, or a streamed sequence of chat completion
        chunk objects if the request is streamed.

        Create the structure of an evaluation that can be used to test a model's performance.
        An evaluation is a set of testing criteria and the config for a data source, which dictates the schema of the data used in the evaluation. After creating an evaluation, you can run it on different models and model parameters. We support several types of graders and datasources.
        For more information, see the [Evals guide](/docs/guides/evals).

        Upload a file that can be used across various endpoints. Individual files
        can be up to 512 MB, and each project can store up to 2.5 TB of files in
        total. There is no organization-wide storage limit.

        - The Assistants API supports files up to 2 million tokens and of specific
          file types. See the [Assistants Tools guide](/docs/assistants/tools) for
          details.
        - The Fine-tuning API only supports `.jsonl` files. The input also has
          certain required formats for fine-tuning
          [chat](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input) or
          [completions](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input) models.
        - The Batch API only supports `.jsonl` files up to 200 MB in size. The input
          also has a specific required
          [format](/docs/api-reference/batch/request-input).

        Please [contact us](https://help.openai.com/) if you need to increase these
        storage limits.

        You can call this endpoint with either:

        - `multipart/form-data`: use binary uploads via `image` (and optional `mask`).
        - `application/json`: use `images` (and optional `mask`) as references with either `image_url` or `file_id`.

        Note that JSON requests use `images` (array) instead of the multipart `image` field.

      summary: |
        Create a Realtime client secret with an associated session configuration.

        Client secrets are short-lived tokens that can be passed to a client app,
        such as a web frontend or mobile client, which grants access to the Realtime API without
        leaking your main API key. You can configure a custom TTL for each client secret.

        You can also attach session configuration options to the client secret, which will be
        applied to any sessions created using that client secret, but these can also be overridden
        by the client connection.

        [Learn more about authentication with client secrets over WebRTC](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc).

        Returns the created client secret and the effective session object. The client secret is a string that looks like `ek_1234`.

        Create an ephemeral API token for use in client-side applications with the
        Realtime API. Can be configured with the same session parameters as the
        `session.update` client event.

        It responds with a session object, plus a `client_secret` key which contains
        a usable ephemeral API token that can be used to authenticate browser clients
        for the Realtime API.

        Returns the created Realtime session object, plus an ephemeral key.

            to normalize payload sizes as a mitigation to certain side-channel
            attacks. These obfuscation fields are included by default, but add a
            small amount of overhead to the data stream. You can set

      summary: |
        When a run has the `status: "requires_action"` and `required_action.type` is `submit_tool_outputs`, this endpoint can be used to submit the outputs from the tool calls once they're all completed. All outputs must be submitted in a single request.

        Stream the result of executing a Run or resuming a Run after submitting tool outputs.
        You can stream events from the [Create Thread and Run](/docs/api-reference/runs/createThreadAndRun),
        [Create Run](/docs/api-reference/runs/createRun), and [Submit Tool Outputs](/docs/api-reference/runs/submitToolOutputs)
        endpoints by passing `"stream": true`. The response will be a [Server-Sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events) stream.
        Our Node and Python SDKs provide helpful utilities to make streaming easy. Reference the
        [Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn more.
